# Executive Summary
Using R Studios, the machine learning algorithms Random Forest and XGboost were utilized towards examining college admissions for prospective students targeting programs in marketing, HR, or Finance at Jain University Bangalore via the campus recruitement data set gathered from Kaggle. Overall, the Random Forest model produced greater accuracy towards predicting whether someone was admitted into college. Accordingly, for prospective students, I would advice that using one's own information in regard to the variables presented in the model serves as a good indicator as to whether or not admissions is likely. 

## Problem

For individuals looking to pursue higher education, applying to college can be a daunting task. Through an analysis of various contributing factors potentially influencing college admissions, a model predicting acceptance would be a worthwhile tool for an individual to utilize and assess whether their current credentials are viable towards getting accepted or if additional work might be required. 

## Methodology

The primary variable in question from the data set is "status" indicating whether an individual placed or didn't place when applying to schools. Accordingly, this served as the predicted variable while the remainder of the data set in question were the predictors. Machine learning algorithms, via the ensemble methods Random Forest and XGboost, were targeted as high performing systems capable of developing classification models. This was achieved, for both machine learning methods, by performing a 70:30 split of the data in R Studio, training the respective model with the majority of the split, testing the model's accuracy via the remaining data portion along with a confusion matrix, and then finally a visualization towards how influential each variable was on their respective model.
